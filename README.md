## Hello World ðŸŒŽ

### A little about myself...

I'm an early career iOS developer and I'm focused on developing my programming skills. Here I have some projects that I developed to improve my knowledge in iOS technologies, you will see that in some projects I decided to train design pattern, dependencies and UI element developing approach like ViewCode, Xibs, Storyboards and SwiftUI. In others I trained everything and in some nothing. haha My goal is to keep learning and growing.
